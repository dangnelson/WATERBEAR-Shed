### Eave Fascia
Burn & oil 2 1x6x8s and 2 1x6x12s to use as Eave Fascia. Rather than trusting blueprints for finishing pieces, it's better to measure the actual structure to compensate for any warping that may have occurred. 

### Cutting Tip
You can measure and precut the boards before burning & oiling them or you can cut them afterwards and use a *Butane Torch* loaded with *Butane* to touch up the exposed areas.

### Rake Fascia
To measure and cut the 4 1x8x12 Boards for the Rake Fascia, first cut 45 degree angles at the end of the boards, then tack them up in place using a *16 Gauge Finishing Nailer* loaded with *1 1/4" Finishing Nails*. This will allow you then mark the bottom edge using the Eave Fascia to make sure they'll line up. Carefully pry the boards away and hammer out the finishing nails before making your cuts.
