## Read the Manufacturer Instructions

This chapter covers generally what you should expect when installing snap-lock roofing. However, there are several manufactures of this type of roofing in the US, and the instructions will vary slightly depending on who you use. Consult with the manufacturer or supplier to get the proper instructions for your installation.

## 01. Fascia

### Eave Fascia
Burn & oil two 1x6x8s and two 1x6x12s to use as Eave Fascia. Rather than trusting blueprints for finishing pieces, it's better to measure the actual structure to compensate for any warping that may have occurred. 

Install the boards 1.5” below where the fascia meets the sheathing. This will maintain the 45 degree pitch. Level each board as you install. Tack the boards in first using *2 1/2” galvanized finishing nails* loaded in the *Finishing Nailer*. Then use two *2 1/2” Hex Deck Screws* to attach the boards to the rafters. This will help provide additional strength to the rafters, and insures the gutters have plenty of support during rainfall.

### Cutting & Burning Tip
You can measure and precut the boards before burning & oiling them or you can cut them afterwards and use a *Butane Torch* loaded with *Butane* to touch up the exposed areas.

### Rake Fascia
To measure and cut the four 1x8x12 Boards for the Rake Fascia, first cut 45 degree angles at the end of the boards, then tack them up in place using a *16 Gauge Finishing Nailer* loaded with *1 1/2" Finishing Nails*. This will allow you then mark the bottom edge using the Eave Fascia to make sure they'll line up. Carefully pry the boards away and hammer out the finishing nails before correcting your marks with a *Speed Square* and making your cuts.

After finishing the boards, install them with *1 1/2" Finishing Nails* where needed and two *2 1/2" Hex Deck Screws*.

## 02. Roof Drip Edge

Install the *Eave Drip Edge* lapped under the underlayment  at the eave using *1" Pancake Head Woodscrews*. Join pieces by trimming the folded sections of the edges so that one can slide into the other. Next install the *Rake Drip Edge* over the underlayment starting at the top.

### Cutting Metal
To trim metal use *Metal Snips* for detail work, and a *Shears Attachment Accessory* attached to your *Driver* for long cuts.
