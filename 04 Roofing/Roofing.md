# Roofing

Look for 24-Gauge, 16" Width, Standing Seam, Snap Lock, Striated, Galvalume Coated, Steel Roofing with Unpainted Mill Finish.

This type of roofing is perfect for rainwater harvesting and ordering it "mill finish" avoids the use of paint.

### Dimensions

If your supplier asks you for the roof dimensions, tell them the roofing coverage area is 10' 6" tall by 19' 1/2" wide.

###s Read the Manufacturer Instructions

This chapter covers generally what you should expect when installing snap-lock roofing. However, there are several manufacturers of this type of roofing in the US, and the instructions will vary slightly depending on who you use. Consult with the manufacturer or supplier to get the proper instructions for your installation.

## 01. Fascia 

![](./images/D01.svg)
	
### Eave Fascia
Burn & oil two 2x6x8s and two 2x6x12s to use as Eave Fascia. Rather than trusting blueprints for your cuts, it's better to measure the actual structure using a *Tape Measure* to compensate for any warping that may have occurred during construction.

Install the boards 1.5” below where the fascia meets the sheathing. This will maintain the 45 degree pitch and insure the roofing extends past the fascia. Level each board as you install. Tack the boards in first using *2 1/2” Galvanized Finishing nails* loaded in the *Finishing Nailer*. Then use two *2 1/2” Hex Deck Screws* to attach the boards to the rafters using your *Impact Driver*. This will help provide additional strength to the rafters, and insures the gutters have plenty of support during rainfall.

### Cutting & Burning Tip
You can measure and precut the boards before burning & oiling them or you can cut them afterwards and use a *Butane Torch* loaded with *Butane* to touch up the exposed areas.

### Rake Fascia
To measure and cut the four 1x8x12 Boards for the Rake Fascia, first cut 45 degree angles at the end of the boards, then tack them up in place using a *16 Gauge Finishing Nailer* loaded with *1 1/2" Finishing Nails*. This will allow you then mark the bottom edge using the Eave Fascia to make sure they'll line up. Carefully pry the boards away and hammer out the finishing nails before correcting your marks with a *Speed Square* and making your cuts.

After finishing the boards, install them with *1 1/2" Finishing Nails* where needed and two *2 1/2" Hex Deck Screws*.

## 02. Drip Edge

### Cutting Metal
To trim metal use *Metal Snips* for detail work, and a *Shears Attachment Accessory* attached to your *Driver* for long cuts. 

### Eave Drip Edge
Install the *Eave Drip Edge* lapped under the underlayment  at the eave using *1" Pancake Head Woodscrews*. Join pieces by trimming the folded sections of the edges so that one can slide into the other. 

If the drip edge is difficult to screw through, pre-drill holes as often as needed.

### Rake Drip Edge
Next install the *Rake Drip Edge* over the underlayment starting at the top. Cut the top edge at a 45 degree angle leaving the first side with some excess on the face which is flush with the fascia. This will allow the second side to sit overtop and give a cleaner look at the joint.

Have one person hold the bottom using the *8 Foot Step Ladder* while another uses the *24' Extension Ladder* attached to the eave with the *Ladder Lock* and the *8' Straight Ladder* hanging over the ridge to climb to the top and screw the drip edge to the sheathing.

For additional pieces, trim the folded sections and slide the lower piece into the upper piece.

## 03. Roofing Panels

Start on the west side and work west to east. This will maximize the time you spend in the shade.

### First Panel

Measure the distance from outside of the rake drip edge to the center of the first rafter. It may be easiest to do this my measuring at the ridge. You'll want your roofing screws to be lined up close to your rafters for strength. Mark a panel of roofing the distance you measured out from the center of the screw holes plus 1 1/8" for the hem. Then draw a line using your *Plumb Chalk Line* and cut it using your *Shears Attachment Accessory*. 

#### Panel Trimming
Next measure 1 1/8" from the bottom of the panel and cut away the standing seam and lapped edge leaving the rest of the panel to be bent under the eave drip edge. When cutting the standing seam leave a small amount on one side to fold in front of the exposed gap for a cleaner look.

#### Bending
Bend the bottom edge 180 degrees by using a *16" Hemming Tool*. Next bend the trimmed side half way along the whole edge and then to 180 degrees to minimize buckling.

#### Installation
Slide the panel onto the roof with the drip edge sliding into the folds. Have one person hold the bottom using the *8 Foot Step Ladder* while another uses the *24' Extension Ladder* attached to the eave with the *Ladder Lock* and the *8' Straight Ladder* hanging over the ridge to climb to the top and screw the panel in using one of the panels manufactured holes. Screw the bottom in using the *Driver* and *1" Pancake Head Woodscrews* and work your way back up using the recommended fastener scheduling from your manufacturer.

### Repeating Panels
For the remaining panels prep them by trimming and bending the bottom edge. Then slide the standing seam along the edge of the previous panel with the end sliding under the drip edge. Use the *Rubber Mallet* to snap the seam into place at the bottom and place the first screw in at the bottom to hold the panel in place. Next snap the rest of the panel into place as you work your way towards the ridge. Once it's snapped in place screw the panel in and move on to the next one.

### Last Panel

For the last panel, snap the bottom on and rest the seam on the lock edge so you can draw a line using the drip edge on the panel as your guide. Take the panel down and measure 1 1/8" out from the line and mark it with your chalk line. Cut and bend the edge before sliding and snapping it into place.

Repeat these steps for the other side of the roof.

Close the bends using a *3" Hand Seamer*.

## 04. Vented Ridge Cap

![](images/D04.svg)

Install the ventilation per manufacturer instructions. 

The ridge cap normally comes in 2 parts, an inner part which screws to the roof and an outer part which slides over it to conceal the screws. 

### Angle Guide
To insure the bottom pieces are at the right angle, make  a guide out of two 2x4s by screwing them together end to end at a 45 degree  angle and cut so the inside of the guide matches the size of the ridge cap. This will allow you to place the guide on the top of the standing seams on the ridge and mark the angle needed on the seams.

### Installation

Install the inner roof cap at the marked angles one side at a time per manufacturer instructions.

For the top ridge section, finish the end first. Measure the depth of the standing seam and combine with 1 1/8" for the underside seam. Mark the end of the cap using the measurements. Cut the top fold to the end of the mark. Use the *3" Hand Seamer * to fold the deepest edge. Fold 180 degrees to finish the edge and unfold it 90 degrees. Then use the *16" Hemming Tool* for the underside. On the other end, cut the seam off 4 inches in so the opposite piece can slide onto the other side.

To slide the piece into place, have one person hold the end you want to slide on towards the ridge using the *24' Extension Ladder* and have another person brace the center by placing a 2x4x8 underneath while standing on the *8' Step Ladder*. Slide it all the way on.

For the next piece it may be easier to slide it on and fit it before marking your lines. This is because it can be difficult to measure the length at that height. To get it on, slide it as far as it will go before climbing the ladders towards to center to join them at the joint.

You'll want to use *Pop Rivets* inserted in to a *Pop Rivet Gun* to compress and flush out the joints. Pre-drill
