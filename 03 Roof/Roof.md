[Supplies List](#supplies)

Wait to start the roof until you have a good few days to work on it. It will be hard to cover until at least the roof sheathing is up. 

Now that the shed is enclosed, you can store the supplies for the roof inside. To help with organization we recommend building a simple lumber rack to accommodate the large materials. It also is helpful to precut the rafters at this stage. You can also assemble the gables in advance since they aren’t too heavy to lift up to the roof with two people.

## 01 Raised Top Plate <a name="raisedtopplate"></a>

Cut the 2x4s to size using the *Battery Powered Handheld Circular Saw* and install them using the *Battery Powered Electric Nail Gun*.

### Fastening

| Placement | Nail Size | Frequency | Occurances 
|---|---|---|---
| Raised Top Plate | 3" | 24" on center | 38' (19 Nails)

## 02 Gables <a name="gables"></a>

Cut, then assemble the gables on a flat surface. Stand them up one at a time, squaring them to the edge. Cut a forty five degree edge onto the end of a 2x4x8. Attach it to the roof floor first, then while using a gable using the Nail Gun to keep it from tipping until the rafters are installed.

## 03 Rafter Overhangs <a name="rafteroverhangs"></a>

![](images/C03.svg)

Precut the rafters to size using the dimensions provided (C.03A). Make sure to cut notches in four of the rafters for the outriggers to sit into (C.03C). To remove the notches, cut multiple grooves to the depth required until it is easy to use a *Chisel* and *Hammer* to remove the excess.

Assemble three of the rafters, which connect to the outriggers, with the overhang blocking (C.03D) before lifting them into place. Nail the rafter bottoms into the raised top plate and nail up from below the gable to secure the center rafter. Repeat for all four corners.

## 04 Ridge Beam <a name="ridgebeam"></a>

![](images/C04.svg)

Next, run a line east to west to determine a straight ridge line. Because of the length of the ridge beam, it is built in two pieces. Cut one of the pieces and measure out and mark where the last two rafters should sit. Install the ridge beam by placing it on a gable and nailing two additional rafters at the end in place. Make sure the ridge beam stays true to your line to keep your roof from being warped.Nail the ridge beam to the rafters that are supported by the outriggers. Repeat for other side.

For additional support nail *Connecting Plates* to the ridge beam joint.

## 05 Rafters <a name="rafters"></a>

Install the remaining rafters using the provided nailing schedule. Attach hurricane ties using screws where the rafters meet the raised top plate.

### Rafter Nail Fastening

| Placement | Nail Size | Frequency | Occurances | 3.5"  Nails
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Rafter to plate, toe nail | 3.5" | 2 | 32 | 64
| Rafter to ridge, toe nail | 3.5" | 4 | 32 | 128
|**Total**|||| 192

## 06 Collar Ties <a name="collarties"></a>
 
![](images/C06.svg)

Install collar ties to help prevent the rafters from coming apart at the top.

### Collar Tie Fastening `IRC Table 602.3(1)`

| Placement | Size | Frequency
| --- | --- | ---
| Collar tie to rafter, face nail | 3" | 3 nails on each side | 6 connections (9 Nails)

## 07 Roof Sheathing <a name="roofsheathing"></a>

![](images/C07.svg)

Roof sheathing must be at least 5/8 inches thick (IRC TABLE R803.1)

Installing the roof sheathing is the most laborious part of this design. Make sure to have at least two additional people helping you. Build simple slides out of four 2x6x12’s, this will help you guild the sheathing up to the roof. Notch a square corner out of spare 2x4 to use as a pushing stick. 

Tack the slide to the rafters ends, then have one to two people life the plywood up to the 2 people on the roof. Have one person on the roof tack the plywood into place using the nail gun, once you confirm it is square to the bottom of the rafters. Install H-Clips between the panels to add spacing between the panels so they can expand. Plywood is staggered for strength. Finish the nailing schedule for each piece before continuing to the next. Start with installing the bottom pieces before the top.

### Estimate

* 24' edge length for each 4x8 = 48 nails per sheet
* Two 8' center lengths for each 4x8 = 16 nails per sheet

| Placement | Size | Frequency | Occurrences
|---|---|---|---|
| Edges on Studs | 2 or 2.5" | Every 6" on center | 12 sheets (576 Nails)
| Center on Studs | 2 or 2.5" | Every 12" on center | 12 sheets (192 Nails)
|**Total**|||768 Nails

## Cover with Tarp

This is a good time to figure out how to cover the structure with a tarp so you are protected and can take a break before starting the roofing. We wrapped a tarp over the roof and under the rake overhangs, tying off to the overhang blocking. Until we had the gable felt installed, we tied a tarp off starting with a corner under the ridge overhang and down to the eaves.

## 11 Eave End Blocking <a name="eaveendblocking"></a>

Use Scrap lumber from the rafters to build out the eave end blocking. This will give you something to attach the fascia to.
