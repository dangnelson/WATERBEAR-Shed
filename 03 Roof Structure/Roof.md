Wait to start the roof until you have a good few days to work on it. It will be hard to cover until at least the roof sheathing is up because of wind.

Now that the shed is enclosed, you can store the supplies for the roof inside. To help with organization we recommend building a simple lumber rack to accommodate the large materials. Precut the rafters and assemble the gables in advance.


## 01 Raised Top Plate <a name="raisedtopplate"></a>

Cut the 2x4s to size using the *Battery Powered Handheld Circular Saw* and install them using the *Battery Powered Electric Nail Gun*.

### Fastening

| Placement | Nail Size | Frequency | Occurances 
|---|---|---|---
| Raised Top Plate | 3" | 24" on center | 38' (19 Nails)

## 02 Gables <a name="gables"></a>

Cut, then assemble the gables on a flat surface. Stand them up one at a time, squaring them to the edge. Cut a forty five degree edge onto the end of a spare 2x4x8. Nail it to the roof floor first, then while leveling the gable, attach it to the center beam to keep it from tipping until the rafters are installed.

## 03 Rafter Overhangs <a name="rafteroverhangs"></a>

![](images/C03.svg)

Precut the rafters to size using the dimensions provided (C.03A). Make sure to cut notches in four of the rafters for the outriggers to sit into (C.03C). To remove the notches, adjust the *Circular Saw* to the depth required and cut multiple grooves until it is easy to use a *Chisel* and *Hammer* to remove the excess.

Assemble three of the rafters, which connect to the outriggers, with the overhang blocking (C.03D) before lifting them into place. Nail the rafter bottoms into the raised top plate and nail up from below the gable to secure the center rafter. Repeat for all four corners.

## 04 Ridge Beam <a name="ridgebeam"></a>

![](images/C04.svg)

Next, run a line east to west to determine a straight ridge line. Because of the length of the ridge beam, it is built in two pieces. Cut one of the pieces and measure out and mark where the last two rafters should sit. Install the ridge beam by placing it on a gable and nailing two additional rafters at the end in place. Make sure the ridge beam stays true to your line to keep your roof from being warped.Nail the ridge beam to the rafters that are supported by the outriggers. Repeat for other side.

For additional support nail *Connecting Plates* to the ridge beam joint.

## 05 Rafters <a name="rafters"></a>

![](images/C05.svg)

Install the remaining rafters using the provided nailing schedule. Attach hurricane ties using screws where the rafters meet the raised top plate.

### Rafter Nail Fastening

| Placement | Nail Size | Frequency | Occurances | Nails
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Rafter to plate, toe nail | 3.5" | 2 | 32 | 64
| Rafter to ridge, toe nail | 3.5" | 4 | 32 | 128
|**Total**|||| 192

## 06 Collar Ties <a name="collarties"></a>
 
![](images/C06.svg)

Install collar ties to help prevent the rafters from coming apart at the top.

### Collar Tie Fastening `IRC Table 602.3(1)`

| Placement | Size | Frequency
| --- | --- | ---
| Collar tie to rafter, face nail | 3" | 3 nails on each side | 6 connections (9 Nails)

## 07 Roof Sheathing <a name="roofsheathing"></a>

![](images/C07.svg) 

Roof sheathing must be at least 5/8 inches thick (IRC TABLE R803.1)

Installing the roof sheathing is the most laborious part of this design. Make sure to have at least two additional people helping you. Build simple slides out of four 2x6x12â€™s, this will help you guild the sheathing up to the roof. Notch a square corner out of spare 2x4 to use as a pushing stick. 

Tack the slide to the rafters ends, then have one to two people life the plywood up to the 2 people on the roof. Have one person on the roof tack the plywood into place using the nail gun, once you confirm it is square to the bottom of the rafters. Install H-Clips between the panels to add spacing between the panels so they can expand. Plywood is staggered for strength. Finish the nailing schedule for each piece before continuing to the next. Start with installing the bottom pieces before the top.

### Sheathing Fastening  `IRC TABLE R602.3(1)`

* 24' edge length for each 4x8 = 48 nails per sheet
* Two 8' center lengths for each 4x8 = 16 nails per sheet

| Placement | Size | Frequency | Occurrences
|---|---|---|---|
| Edges on Studs | 2.5" | Every 6" on center | 12 sheets (576 Nails)
| Center on Studs | 2.5" | Every 12" on center | 12 sheets (192 Nails)
|**Total**|||768 Nails

## Cover with Tarp

This is a good time to figure out how to cover the structure with a tarp so you are protected and can take a break while finishing the gables. We wrapped a tarp over the roof and under the rake overhangs, tying off to the overhang blocking. Until we had the gable felt installed, we tied another tarp off starting with a corner under the ridge overhang and down to the eaves.

### Sheathing Fastening

* 24' edge length for each 4x8 = 48 nails per sheet
* Two 8' center lengths for each 4x8 = 16 nails per sheet

| Placement | Nail Size | Frequency | Occurrences
|---|---|---|---|
| Edges on Studs | 2 or 2.5" | Every 6" on center | 4 sheets (192 Nails)
| Center on Studs | 2 or 2.5" | Every 12" on center | 4 sheets (64 Nails)
|**Total**|||256 Nails



## 09 Gable Felt <a name="gablefelt"></a>

## 10 Roof Felt <a name="rooffelt"></a>

![](images/C10.svg) 

## Cover Until Next Step

Cut an 8 inch strip of Roof Felt to cover the ridge beam. This will make the structure water proof enough for you to no longer have to use a tarp as cover. Nail it down with cap nails as it will be prone to fly off in heavy wind. You'll remove this piece once you're ready to install the ridge cap for the roofing.
