## Wall Exterior

The space between wall paper and siding is called a rain screen. It assumes that water will eventually get behind the siding, and when it does, gives the water a place to go, and enough ventilation for it to dry.

### Insect Screen

Insect screen is installed at the top and bottom of the rain screen to keep insects from living behind your siding.

We used a product called Coravent, which is corrugated plastic with a plastic fabric mesh on one side. We’re currently looking for a plastic-free alternative. Please contact us if you’re aware of one.

16 4' strips for top

### Furring Strips

Furring strips are attached vertically inline with the studs. Since the rafters line up with the studs, simply place the top of a strip inline with the rafter center at the top and then level, resting the bottom on the insect screen.
