## Wall Exterior

The space between wall paper and siding is called a rain screen. It assumes that water will eventually get behind the siding due to horizontal rain, and when it does, gives the water a place to go, and enough ventilation for it to dry.

### 01. Insect Screen

An insect screen is installed at the top and bottom of the rain screen to keep insects from living behind your siding while allowing ventilation and drainage.

We used a product called *Coravent*, corrugated plastic strips with a plastic fabric mesh on one side. We’re currently looking for a plastic-free alternative. Please contact us if you’re aware of one.

Tack the strips in first using *2 1/2” Galvanized Finishing nails* loaded in the *Finishing Nailer* as needed.

## 02. Furring Strips

*1"x2"x8' Furring Strips* are attached vertically inline with the studs. Since the rafters line up with the studs, simply place the top of a strip inline with the rafter center at the top and then *Level*, resting the bottom on the insect screen. Tack in with finishing nails as needed.

## 03. Eave End Blocking

Use leftover lumber from the rafters to build out eave end blocking. This will give you something to attach the siding to. Install using the *Battery Powered Electric Nail Gun* loaded with *2.5" Nails*.
