## International Residential Code Compliant

This guide has made an attempt to document the associated code requirements in the "International Residential Code" which is adopted by most areas of the US. Code references are labeled with the relevant IRC section like so: `IRC *`.

You can find a version of the code adopted for your area here:

## Off-Grid Tools

Purchase Battery-Powered Tools from the same manufacturer that use the same batteries. This will save you money as you can buy "Tool-Only" versions online once you have a 3-4 batteries on hand. Make sure the manufacturer makes a car charger for the batteries. Car cigarette lighter outlets provide DC power and are common ports used by simple solar panel setups. This will allow you to charge your batteries directly off a solar panel with a charge controller rather than having to use a more expensive power inverter setup.

## Suppliers

Finding suppliers can be difficult if you're new. Talk with local contractors or read reviews of local supply companies. Look for a roofing supplier and lumber yard early and make sure they carry what you'll need before working with them and establishing a relationship. Working with suppliers can be a much more personal experience than going to a big box store as they tend to work with the same contractors for years and know each other on a first name basis.
