## Survey

### Zoning Setbacks
Check your local zoning regulations for `Setback Requirements` to find the minimum distance from your property line and other structures before deciding on a location.

### Find Level Location
To avoid major excavation, find a location which is fairly level. You can do this easiley by using the *String on Reel* tied between two stakes. Once you've found a rough location, attach a *String Level* to the string to gauge how much excavation will be needed.

### Mark Pier Locations

Use *Marking Spray Paint* and a *Measuring Tape* to roughly mark the locations of the piers. Press *Stakes* into marked corners, then measure from corner to corner and adjust the stakes until all the measurements are correct. When your finished pound the stakes several inches in with a *Hammer* to keep them from moving.

Use the *String on Reel* to connect the stakes to make a square. Measure out 12 inches from the string and mark several points then use the marking spray paint to connect the points to create a box.

### Remove Grass & Debris

Carefully choose a location for a soil pile and sod pile that's well out of the way.

Use the *Shovel(s)* and *Wheel Barrow* to remove any grass, shrubs or debris from the top layer of the marked out box.

### Level Ground

Attach *String Levels* to the four sides on the string and level starting roughly an inch above the ground at the highest point. Use this as a guide to remove top soil until the ground is leveled.

### Retaining Wall

If building on an incline you may end up with a soil ledge on one side and will need to build a retaining wall to avoid erosion. You may also want to dig a trench for a french drain on the inside of the retaining wall and filling it with crushed stone. This will increase your build time and is not recommended for that reason.

### Dig Pier Holes

Rent an auger and use the *Digging Tools* if you have rocky soil.

Dig out the bottom of the hole so it flares out at the bottom to resist frost heave and lift from strong winds.

### Pour Piers
Cut the tube to size using a *Hand Saw*.

Nail the sides of the *Cardboard Concrete Form Tubes* to the center of 2 2x4s so the tube is about 12 inches up from the bottom of the footing.

Slowly pour *Water* over 1 *Bag of Concrete* in the *Wheel Barrow* and mix using the *Garden Hoe* until you have a thick consistency.

Make sure to wear a *Respitory Mask* to avoid breathing in concrete dust, and 

Then shovel the concrete
